### 1.  Run the GameRanger Setup application.
    
   Open the file  GameRangerSetup.exe  and click  Install.  
      
   If a message appears asking if you are sure you want to run this file, click  Run.
    
### 2.  Create a new free account.
    
   GameRanger will prompt you to create a new GameRanger account or use an existing one, and you will need to enter your valid e-mail address. You should use the address your friends are most likely to know.
    
### 3.  Activate your account and log in.
    
   Within minutes you should receive a confirmation e-mail to activate your GameRanger account. If it's not in your inbox, try looking in your junk folder, and mark it as a trusted-sender, or "not spam." Adding the sender to your address book is also a good idea.
    
### 4.  Invite your friends.
    
   Under the  Community  menu, there are various options to invite your friends to try GameRanger. You can also search to see if they already have GameRanger accounts.
    
### 5. Host or Join a game.
   To join an existing game, select a game room from the list and click  Join Game. If the game room has a green dot next to it, then it is already playing. Some games do not allow you to join if they have already started. Alternatively, you can create a new game by clicking  Host Game.
